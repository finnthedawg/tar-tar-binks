[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SamSamhuns/tar-tar-binks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SamSamhuns/tar-tar-binks)

A unix-based tar utility that flattens out the file hierarchy and creates a archived package that can be inspected and unarchived for later use.

## Build
```shell
$ make all
```

## Clean
```shell
$ make clean
```

## Run instructions
Each flag option can only be run one at a time except for when -x is used with -o.
```shell
$ tartar {-c | -a | -x | -m | -p | -o NUMBER} <archive-file> <file/directory list>
```

## Flag options

-   `-c` stores in the archive file <archive-file>, the files and/or directories provided by the list <file/directory list>.
If other additional files/directories exist in <directory list>, then all this content is recursively stored in the <archive-file>

-   `-a` appends filesystem entities indicated in the <file/directory list> in the archived file <archive-file> that already
exists. If additional files and directories exist in <file/directory list>, they are recursively appended in the
designated with <archive-file>.

-   `-x` extracts all files and catalogs that have been archived in file <archive-file>. **If `-o` specified, then adtar will extract the files
with NUMBER<sup>th</sup> occurrence of each file.** If option -o is not specified it will extract the latest occurrence

-   `-m` prints out the meta-data (owner, group, rights, type of file) for all files/directories that have been archived in <archive-file>.

-   `-p` displays the hierarchy(-ies) of the files and directories stored in the <archive-file>.
